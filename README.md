Elegancy jewellery is my fifth and final project, part of the Code Institute, Full Stack Web Developer Course.
The purpose of this project was a build a full-stack site based around a business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. The technologies used for this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django. Stripe handles online test payments and Heroku Postgres as a relational database.
