## Bugs

* Bugs
1. User and Superuser Seeing the Same Order History:

Issue: Both regular users and superusers should have separate order histories.
Resolution: I update the order history retrieval logic. When a user logs in, ensure that they only see their own orders. Superusers should have access to all orders. This can be done by checking the user's role and filtering the orders accordingly.

2. HomePage Update Not Reflecting Changes:

Issue: The home page is not dynamically updating with new products or information.
Resolution: Found the right way how to fix this in Stack Overflow.

3. Bag Item Limit vs. Checkout Item Limit Discrepancy

Issue: Users can add more than two items in the checkout process, even though there is a limit of two items in the bag.
Resolution: Fixed item limits throughout the shopping process.  Had to make that input will be able to increase only until 2 quantity after 2 quantity button is disable.

3. Pagination Breaking Functionality of Sort By, Search, and Categories:

Issue: Pagination is interfering with the sorting, searching, and filtering functionality.
Resolution: Changed sort by, search and categories view logical that the sorting, searching, and filtering parameters are maintained across paginated pages. 

4. 404 Page Not Working as Expected:
 
Issue: The 404 page doesn't seem to be functioning correctly.
Resolution: Should remove 500 error after that 404 error start show up.

5. Mobile Responsiveness Issues

Issue: The website doesn't display properly on mobile devices, leading to a poor mobile user experience.
Resolution: Implement responsive web design to ensure that  website adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Test the website on various mobile devices and browsers to identify and fix layout and usability issues.

6. Users Can Add the Same Product Multiple Times to Wishlist

Issue:Users are able to add the same product multiple times to their wishlist, which is not the intended behavior. This issue leads to duplicate entries in the wishlist, causing confusion and potential user experience problems.
Revolution: Implement appropriate validation checks to prevent duplicate entries in the wishlist database.

## Unfixed Bugs

1. Search bar

Issue with  Search Functionality:

Issue: Users have difficulty finding products due to search functionality. Unable to search by categories.Will show 0 products found.Also by type gold you will be see silver products also.

2. Sort by
